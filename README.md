# Background

A few weeks ago, it was announced that [hundreds of Instagram Chrome extensions were infected with malware](https://press.avast.com/third-party-browser-extensions-from-instagram-facebook-vimeo-and-others-infected-with-malware). The specific downloader I used was on that list, and so, left with no other option, I decided to write my own.

# About

This is a Chrome extension for downloading Instagram posts.

# Usage/Features

Navigate to a specific Instagram post's page, e.g: `https://www.instagram.com/p/CKW1c2PLbq2/` then click the download icon in your toolbar.

Supports all kinds of Instagram posts, both single and multiple, and includes video.

Does *not* support downloading from Stories or Story Highlights (yet!).
